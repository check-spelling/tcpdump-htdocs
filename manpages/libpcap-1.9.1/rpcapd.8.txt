RPCAPD(8)                   System Manager's Manual                  RPCAPD(8)

NAME
       rpcapd  -  capture daemon to be controlled by a remote libpcap applica-
       tion

SYNOPSIS
       rpcapd [ -b address ] [ -p port ] [ -4 ] [ -l host_list ]
               [ -a host,port ] [ -n ] [ -v ] [ -d ] [ -i ]
               [ -D ] [ -s config_file ] [ -f config_file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rpcapd is a daemon (Unix) or service (Win32) that  allows  the  capture
       and filter part of libpcap to be run on a remote system.

       Rpcapd can run in two modes: passive mode (default) and active mode.

       In  passive  mode, the client (e.g., a network sniffer) connects to rp-
       capd.  It then sends hem the appropriate commands to start the capture.

       In active mode, rpcapd tries  to  establish  a  connection  toward  the
       client (e.g., a network sniffer). The client then sends the appropriate
       commands to rpcapd to start the capture.

       Active mode is useful in case rpcapd is run behind a firewall and  can-
       not  receive  connections from the external world. In this case, rpcapd
       can be configured to establish the connection to a  given  host,  which
       has to be configured in order to wait for that connection. After estab-
       lishing the connection, the protocol continues its job  in  almost  the
       same way in both active and passive mode.

Configuration file
       The user can create a configuration file in the same folder of the exe-
       cutable, and put the configuration commands in there. In order for  rp-
       capd  to  execute  the  commands, you have to restart it on Win32, i.e.
       the initialization file is parsed only at the beginning). The UNIX ver-
       sion  of rpcapd will reread the configuration file when receiving a HUP
       signel. In that case, all the existing  connections  remain  in  place,
       while  the new connections will be created according to the new parame-
       ters.

       In case a user does not want to create the configuration file manually,
       they  can  launch  rpcapd  with the requested parameters plus "-s file-
       name".  Rpcapd will parse all the parameters and  save  them  into  the
       specified configuration file.

Installing rpcapd on Win32
       The  remote  daemon is installed automatically when installing WinPcap.
       The installation process  places  the  rpcapd  file  into  the  WinPcap
       folder.   This file can be executed either from the command line, or as
       a service.  For instance, the installation process updates the list  of
       available  services  list and it creates a new item (Remote Packet Cap-
       ture Protocol v.0 (experimental) ).  To avoid  security  problems,  the
       service  is inactive and it has to be started manually (control panel -
       administrative tools - services - start).

       The service has a set of "standard" parameters,  i.e.  it  is  launched
       with  the -d flag (in order to make it run as a service) and the -f rp-
       capd.ini flag.

Starting rpcapd on Win32
       The rpcapd executable can be launched directly, i.e.  it can run in the
       foreground  as  well (not as a daemon/service).  The procedure is quite
       simple: you have to invoke the executable from the  command  line  with
       all  the  requested  parameters  except  for  the -d flag.  The capture
       server will start in the foreground.

Installing rpcapd on Unix-like systems
       TBD

Starting rpcapd on Unix-like systems
       rpcapd needs sufficient privileges to perform packet capture, e.g.  run
       as  root  or be owned by root and have suid set. Most operating systems
       provide more elegant solutions when run as user than  the  above  solu-
       tions, all of them different.

OPTIONS
       -b address
              Bind  to  the IP address specified by address (either numeric or
              literal).  By default, rpcapd binds to all local IPv4  and  IPv6
              addresses.

       -p port
              Bind to the port specified by port.  By default, rpcapd binds to
              port 2002.

       -4     Listen only on IPv4 addresses.  By default,  rpcapd  listens  on
              both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

       -l host_list
              Only  allow hosts specified in the host_list argument to connect
              to this server.  host_list is a list of host  names  or  IP  ad-
              dresses,  separated by commas.  We suggest that you use host
              names rather than literal IP addresses in order to  avoid  prob-
              lems with different address families.

       -n     Permit NULL authentication (usually used with -l).

       -a host,port
              Run  in  active  mode, connecting to host host on port port.  In
              case port is omitted, the default port (2003) is used.

       -v     Run in active mode only; by default, if -a is specified,  rpcapd
              it accepts passive connections as well.

       -d     Run  in  daemon  mode  (UNIX  only) or as a service (Win32 only)
              Warning (Win32): this switch is provided automatically when  the
              service is started from the control panel.

       -i     Run in inetd mode (UNIX only).

       -D     Log debugging messages.

       -s config_file
              Save  the  current  configuration  to  config_file in the format
              specified by rpcapd-config(5).

       -f config_file
              Load the current configuration from config_file  in  the  format
              specified  by  rpcapd-config(5); all switches specified from the
              command line are ignored.

       -h     Print this help screen.
